# Abstract Factory

Design pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Frequency of use: High (5/5)

Projects:
- AbstractFactory.Core
- AbstractFactory.Infrastructure

# Builder

Design pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

Frequency of use: Medium-Low (2/5)

Projects:
- Builder.Core
- Builder.Infrastructure

# Factory Method

Design pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This pattern lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

Frequency of use: High (5/5)

Projects:
- FactoryMethod.Core
- FactoryMethod.Infrastructure

# Prototype

Design pattern specifies the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

Frequency of use: Medium (3/5)

Projects:
- Prototype.Core
- Prototype.Infrastructure

# Abstract Factory

Design pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Projects:
- AbstractFactory.Core
- AbstractFactory.Infrastructure

# Builder

Design pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

Projects:
- Builder.Core
- Builder.Infrastructure

# Factory Method

Design pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This pattern lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

Projects:
- FactoryMethod.Core
- FactoryMethod.Infrastructure
